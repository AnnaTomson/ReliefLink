### Project Description
The ReliefLink mobile application connects donors directly with disaster-affected individuals, bypassing intermediaries to promote transparency and efficiency. It provides real-time updates on camp needs, enabling donors to contribute targeted resources, and utilizes an impact factor to prioritize aid for the most vulnerable. By streamlining the distribution process, ReliefLink ensures equitable support and empowers donors to make meaningful contributions to disaster recovery efforts.

### The Problem statement
Current disaster relief systems often rely on government intermediaries to distribute funds, leading to inefficiencies and potential corruption. This can result in some individuals receiving aid while others, equally in need, do not. To address these issues, this project proposes a mobile application that facilitates direct transfers from donors to those in need, bypassing intermediaries and ensuring that aid reaches the intended recipients.
